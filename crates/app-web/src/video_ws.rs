//! `GET /api/watch/video`: the Stage 14H.5 browser video carrier - a same-origin
//! WebSocket that forwards the still-encoded AV1 objects `App::start_watch_encoded`
//! queues onto the [`crate::wire`] binary format, for `static/app.js`'s `VideoDecoder`.
//!
//! This is presentation only: it neither starts nor stops a watch (`POST /api/watch` /
//! `POST /api/watch/stop`, unchanged, remain the one lifecycle authority - see the
//! crate README, "Browser video" section, for why) and it owns no reconnect, admission
//! or decode logic of its own - it only drains the bounded, already-backpressured
//! [`holochain_moq_app::EncodedVideoQueue`] `App::encoded_video_queue()` already
//! exposes, on a short interval, until the watch finishes or the socket closes.
