//! The entire serialization boundary between `holochain_moq_app::App` and the browser.
//!
//! Per the 14H.0/14H.1 brief: `crates/app` stays independent of any web representation
//! (no `Serialize` derives added there); every type here is instead built *from* `App`'s
//! existing read-only getters, in one place, so no HTTP handler has to know how to read
//! `App`'s state itself. If a handler needs a fact this module cannot already produce
//! from an existing `App` getter, that is a signal the fact does not exist at the
//! application-layer API yet - see this crate's README, "Discovered API gaps", rather
//! than reaching into `App` internals or guessing.
//!
//! Generic over `D: SessionDirectory` for the same reason `App` itself is (see its own
//! docs): the production binary always instantiates `App<HolochainPeerDirectory>`, and
//! this crate's tests instantiate `App<InMemoryPeerDirectory>` against the exact same
//! code, without a conductor - the pattern `crates/app`'s own tests already use.
